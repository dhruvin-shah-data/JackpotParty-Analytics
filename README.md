## 📌 Overview

This project simulates an **end-to-end analytics workflow** for a mobile gaming studio (SciPlay) product — **Jackpot Party**. The objective is to transform raw gameplay and transaction data into actionable insights that support decision-making across:

- 🎮 Game health monitoring
- 👤 Player engagement analysis
- 🎯 LiveOps evaluation
- 💰 Monetization performance

---

## 🧠 Business Context

Mobile game teams rely on accurate and well-defined metrics to track stability, understand player behavior, measure the effectiveness of LiveOps initiatives, and optimize revenue strategies.

This project reflects how an analytics team would respond to those needs using **structured data modeling** and **KPI-driven dashboards**.

---

## ❓ Stakeholder Questions

| # | Business Question |
|---|-------------------|
| 1 | Is the game stable and healthy over time? |
| 2 | How deeply and frequently are players engaging with the game? |
| 3 | Which LiveOps cohorts drive higher player engagement? |
| 4 | Which regions and user segments generate the most revenue? |
| 5 | Which offers and gameplay mechanics contribute most to monetization and activity? |

---

## 🚀 Suggested Next Steps

- [ ] Investigate crash spikes in relation to release timelines and platform versions
- [ ] Analyze retention and conversion metrics for LiveOps participants vs non-participants
- [ ] Deep-dive into high-performing regions and offers to understand monetization drivers
- [ ] Validate gameplay activity patterns by machine with additional cohorts and time windows
- [ ] Expand dataset beyond January 2024 for trend and seasonality analysis

## 💡 Key Learnings

- Translating stakeholder questions into well-defined KPIs leads to more meaningful analysis than starting from available data alone
- Early alignment on metric definitions reduces ambiguity and prevents downstream rework
- A layered data model (Bronze → Silver → Gold) improves data reliability and simplifies business logic
- Business-friendly metric naming significantly improves dashboard usability and stakeholder trust
- Thorough documentation of assumptions is as important as correct SQL when delivering analytics projects
